# LinkedList
Day 15

Complete the insert function in your editor so that it creates a new Node (pass 'data' as the Node constructor argument) 
and inserts it at the tail of the linked list referenced by the 'head' parameter. Once the new node is added, return the reference to the 'head' node.

Note: If the 'head' argument passed to the insert function is null, then the initial list is empty.

Sample Input

The following input is handled for you by the locked code in the editor: 
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. 
The  subsequent lines of test cases each contain an integer to be inserted at the list's tail.

4
2

1

Sample Output

The locked code in your editor prints the ordered data values for each element in your list as a single line of space-separated integers:

2 3 4 1
